//Went over assigning variables and storing data types and chaning variable values (briefly went over let, var, const for strict variable assignments), for example:
/*let x = 5;
console.log(x);

x = 15;

console.log(x);
*/

//const pi = 3.142;

//console.log("Pi is", pi)

/*
Reviewed string concatenation types
name = "Yousef"
string_1 = "Hello! My name is" + name + "."
or 
string_2 = `Hello! My name is ${name}.`
*/
//name = "Yousef";
//string_2 = `Hello! My name is ${name}.`;
//console.log(string_2);
